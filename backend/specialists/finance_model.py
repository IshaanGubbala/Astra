_FINANCE_MODEL_INSTRUCTIONS = (
    "FINANCIAL MODEL BUILD SEQUENCE (execute every step in order):\n\n"

    "STEP 1 — GATHER CONTEXT\n"
    "Read shared context for: company name, industry/vertical, current MRR or ARR, "
    "current headcount, monthly burn rate, cash on hand, pricing model (per seat / usage / flat), "
    "average contract value (ACV), sales cycle, CAC, LTV, churn rate, and any stated assumptions. "
    "If values are missing, apply reasonable industry defaults and state them explicitly.\n\n"

    "STEP 2 — KEY ASSUMPTIONS TABLE\n"
    "Define and state every assumption before building any model. Required assumptions:\n"
    "  • Starting MRR / ARR\n"
    "  • Monthly new customer additions (conservative / base / aggressive)\n"
    "  • Monthly churn rate (%)\n"
    "  • Average revenue per customer per month\n"
    "  • COGS as % of revenue (hosting, support, payment processing)\n"
    "  • S&M spend per month (and as % of revenue)\n"
    "  • R&D spend per month\n"
    "  • G&A spend per month\n"
    "  • CAC (blended)\n"
    "  • LTV (average revenue per customer / churn rate)\n"
    "  • Payback period (CAC / monthly gross profit per customer)\n"
    "  • Starting cash balance\n"
    "  • Any planned funding events (date, amount)\n\n"

    "STEP 3 — OPTIONAL BENCHMARK LOOKUP\n"
    "If industry benchmarks are not already in context, run:\n"
    "  search_and_fetch('{vertical} SaaS gross margin COGS benchmark 2024 2025')\n"
    "  search_and_fetch('{vertical} CAC payback period LTV benchmark startup')\n"
    "Use findings only to validate or calibrate assumptions — do not delay model output waiting for searches.\n\n"

    "STEP 4 — 12-MONTH REVENUE MODEL (3 SCENARIOS)\n"
    "Build a month-by-month table (Month 1 … Month 12) for Conservative, Base, and Aggressive scenarios.\n"
    "Each scenario table must include columns:\n"
    "  Month | New Customers | Churned Customers | Total Customers | MRR | ARR Run-Rate\n"
    "Conservative: 70% of base new customer additions, 20% higher churn.\n"
    "Base: stated assumptions.\n"
    "Aggressive: 140% of base new customer additions, 15% lower churn.\n"
    "Show all three tables with actual numbers (no placeholders).\n\n"

    "STEP 5 — BURN RATE & RUNWAY\n"
    "For each scenario, produce a month-by-month cash flow table:\n"
    "  Month | Revenue | COGS | Gross Profit | OpEx (S&M + R&D + G&A) | EBITDA | Cash Balance | Runway Remaining (months)\n"
    "Runway = cash balance / monthly net burn.\n"
    "Highlight the month in which cash reaches zero (if applicable) for each scenario.\n\n"

    "STEP 6 — UNIT ECONOMICS SHEET\n"
    "Produce a single summary table:\n"
    "  Metric | Value | Industry Benchmark | Status (Good / Watch / Red)\n"
    "Metrics: CAC, LTV, LTV:CAC ratio, CAC Payback Period (months), Gross Margin (%), "
    "Net Revenue Retention (NRR %), Monthly Churn %, Logo Churn %, Magic Number, Rule of 40 score.\n"
    "Flag any metric below benchmark as Watch or Red.\n\n"

    "STEP 7 — BREAK-EVEN ANALYSIS\n"
    "Calculate:\n"
    "  • Break-even MRR = Total Monthly Fixed Costs / Gross Margin %\n"
    "  • Break-even customer count = Break-even MRR / ARPU\n"
    "  • Months to break-even for each of the 3 scenarios (interpolate from the revenue tables)\n"
    "Show the formula and the computed value for each.\n\n"

    "STEP 8 — P&L PROJECTION SUMMARY\n"
    "Produce a condensed annual P&L for Year 1 (sum of the 12 months, base scenario) and "
    "projected Year 2 / Year 3 (simple growth extrapolation):\n"
    "  | Item | Y1 | Y2 | Y3 |\n"
    "  Revenue, COGS, Gross Profit, S&M, R&D, G&A, Total OpEx, EBITDA, EBITDA Margin %\n\n"

    "STEP 9 — LOG & GENERATE PDF\n"
    "A. obsidian_log with sections: KEY ASSUMPTIONS, REVENUE MODEL (all 3 scenarios), "
    "BURN & RUNWAY, UNIT ECONOMICS, BREAK-EVEN ANALYSIS, P&L PROJECTION.\n"
    "B. generate_pdf(title='12-Month Financial Model', sections=[...]) — include all tables above. "
    "The PDF must stand alone as an investor-ready financial model with every number filled in.\n\n"

    "CRITICAL RULES:\n"
    "  • Never output placeholder text like '[insert value]' — compute actual numbers.\n"
    "  • If data is missing, use a clearly labeled default (e.g., 'Assumed: $500 ACV — no data provided').\n"
    "  • Complete all 9 steps regardless of missing inputs. State assumptions, then compute.\n"
    "  • Call obsidian_log THEN done."
